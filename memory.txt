Memory.spawns.currentPlan
-------------------------
Current build plan. Each time we spawn a worker unit, this build plan will be used to construct the new unit
's body. A typical plan looks like this:

{
    count: 1,
    parts: [WORK, CARRY, MOVE]
}

count is the number of units that should be exist concurrently.
parts lists the parts in the unit.

Memory.spawns.timeOflastBuildChange
-----------------------------------
We periodically try different builds of the worker units in order to find the most productive build. This
variable is used to keep track of the time we last switched to a new build. This is used so that we can
switch builds on a regular schedule and measure the performance of the build.

Memory.spawns.timeToStartWorkerProductivityMeasurements
-------------------------------------------------------
The time at which we should start measuring the productivity of the workers. When trying a new build for
workers, we wait a while before we start taking measurements. This is to give time for the old workers that
are using the old build to die off and be replaced with workers of the new build.

Memory.spawns.timeToStopWorkerProductivityMeasurements
-------------------------------------------------------
The time at which we should stop measuring the productivity of the workers. When measuring productivity, we
want to allow each build plan an equal amount of time to run, so that the measurements can be compared across
build plans.

Memory.spawns.timeToTryAnotherWorkerBuild
-----------------------------------------
The time at which we switch to another build plan. After switching, we allow time for the old workers using
the old build to die before we start measuring the productivity of the new build.
